# WebSearch Integration in RAG Pipeline

## Implementation

### Overview
The WebSearch integration uses the `ddgs` (DuckDuckGo Search) library with optional Tavily support. The implementation combines:

- **DuckDuckGo Search:** Default provider — free, no API key needed. Install with `pip install "polydoc[rag,websearch]"`.
- **Tavily Search:** Optional higher-quality provider. Requires `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable. Install with `pip install "polydoc[rag,websearch]"`.
- **LLM Integration:** Summarizes and integrates retrieved web snippets with RAG results to provide a final answer

## Installation & Search Providers

Install web search dependencies:
```bash
pip install "polydoc[rag,websearch]"
```

| Provider | Default | API Key Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DuckDuckGo | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Free, no setup needed |
| Tavily | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (`TAVILY_API_KEY`) | Higher quality results |

To use Tavily, set the environment variable:
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Configure the provider in your config file:
```yaml
websearch:
    search_provider: "tavily"   # or "duckduckgo" (default)
    max_retries: 3              # retries on rate limit
```


## Customization

Based on the implementation of the `RAG` module, the `Websearch` module enables the creation of a modular Websearch inference pipeline for your indexed multimodal documents, using two inference modes:
 1. **API**: Creates a server hosting the pipeline
 2. **Local**: Runs the inference locally
 
You can customize various parts of the pipeline by defining [an inference Websearch configuration file](/examples/websearchRAG/config_api.yaml).

Users can adjust the pipeline according to their [requirements](/examples/websearchRAG/config.yaml) through the following parameters:

- `use_rag`: Enables or disables RAG retrieval.
- `use_summary`: Activates summarization of retrieved web snippets.
- `n_loops`: Defines the number of search iterations to refine results.
- `n_subqueries`: Specifies the number of subqueries generated for each input query.
- `max_context_tokens`: Maximum token budget for prompts (default: 2048).
- `fast_tokenizer`: If true, estimates tokens as ~4 chars/token instead of using the LLM tokenizer, faster but approximate (default: false).

### Workflow

0. **RAG pipeline:**
    - Launch the RAG pipeline if `use_rag` is enabled and the set the output as being the current knowledge
1. **Input Query Processing:**
   - The pipeline processes the user query and generates subqueries for web searches in order to complete the current knowledge.
2. **WebSearch Execution:**
   - Web searches are performed for each subquery using the configured provider
3. **Summarization:**
   - Retrieved web snippets are summarized using an LLM if `use_summary` is enabled.
4. **Integration with RAG (if use_rag):**
   - WebSearch results are combined with RAG outputs to generate the current knowledge
5. **Start again:**
    - We loop again from step 1 with the updated current knowledge

## Minimal Example

Here is a example to create a Websearch pipeline hosted through [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/) servers.

1. Create your RAG Inference config file based on the [local example](/examples/websearch/config.yaml) or the [API example](/examples/websearch/config_api.yaml).

2. Start your Websearch pipeline using the `run_websearch.py` script and your config file
    ```bash
    python3 -m polydoc websearch --config_file /path/to/config.yaml
    ```

3. In API mode, query the server like any other LangGraph server:
    ```bash
    curl --location --request POST http://localhost:8000/websearch/ \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d ' {
        "query": {
        "input": "When was Barack Obama born?",
        "collection_name": "my_docs"
        },
        "use_rag": true,
        "use_summary": true
        }
    }'
    ```
    In the API mode, it is necessary to provide the `use_rag` and `use_summary`parameters in the query, the number of `n_loops` and `n_subqueries` are defined in the config file.

    In local mode, the pipeline is run directly with the input data specified in the configuration file and the result is saved at the specified path.

    For both mode, if we want to use the RAG pipeline, it is necessay to provide the path to the rag configuration file.

## Results and Outputs

### Output Format
The pipeline provides outputs in the following structure:

- **Short Answer:** Concise response derived from combined RAG and WebSearch results.
- **Detailed Answer:** Expanded response with context from both sources.
- **Sources:** A list of URLs and their respective titles in the format:
  ```json
    {"URL": ["Title 1", "Title 2", ...]}
  ```

### Example Output
```json

    "query": "What are the latest advancements in AI?",
    "rag_informations": "Pre-existing knowledge from RAG.",
    "rag_summary": "Summary of RAG knowledge.",
    "web_summary": "Summarized web search information.",
    "short_answer": "AI advancements include new models and real-time applications.",
    "detailed_answer": "Recent AI developments include breakthroughs in large language models and innovative real-time applications, supported by diverse resources from RAG and web search.",
