# :gear: Process

The process module enables the extraction and standardization of text and images from diverse file formats (listed below), making it ideal for creating datasets for applications such as RAG, multimodal content generation, and preprocessing data for multimodal LLMs/LLMs.

## :hammer: Quick Start
#### :technologist: Global installation
[Setup the project](./installation.md) on each device you want to use using our setup script or looking at what it does and doing it manually.

#### :computer: Running locally
You have to specify the input folders by modifying the [config file](/examples/process/config.yaml). You can also twist the parameters to your needs. Once ready, you can run the process using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m polydoc process --config-file examples/process/config.yaml
```

📌 **Note:**

 We also support processing documents directly from **Google Drive**.

 To enable this feature, the user must create a [Google service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) and download the corresponding secrets as a JSON file. Name that file `client_secrets.json` put it in `googledrive/` (this folder may need to be created at the root of the polydoc repository).

 Make sure your **Google service account** has permission to view the drives you want to process.

The output of the pipeline has the following structure:
```
output_path
├── processors
│   ├── Processor_type_1
│   │   └── results.jsonl
│   ├── Processor_type_2
│   │   └── results.jsonl
│   ├── ...
│   
└── merged
│    └── merged_results.jsonl
|
└── images
```
#### :rocket: Running on distributed nodes

We provide [a simple bash script](/scripts/process_distributed.sh) to run the process on distributed mode. Please call it with your arguments.
```bash
bash scripts/process_distributed.sh -f /path/to/my/input/folder 
```


#### :scroll: Examples
You can find more examples scripts in [the `/examples` directory](/examples).

## :zap: Optimization
### :racing_car: Fast mode

For some file types, we provide a fast mode that will allow you to process the files faster, using a different method. To use it, set the `use_fast_processors` to `true` in the config file.

Be aware that the fast mode might not be as accurate as the default mode, especially for scanned non-native PDFs, which may require Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for more accurate extraction.

### :rocket: Distributed mode

The project is designed to be easily scalable to a multi GPU / multi node environment. To use it, To use it, set the `distributed` to `true` in the config file, and follow the steps described in the [distributed processing](./distributed_processing.md) section.

### :wrench: File type parameters tuning

Many parameters are hardware-dependent and can be customized to suit your needs. For example, you can adjust the processor batch size, dispatcher batch size, and the number of threads per worker to optimize performance.

You can configure parameters by providing a custom config file. You can find an example of a config file in the [examples folder](/examples/process/config.yaml).

:rotating_light: Not all parameters are configurable yet :wink:

### :recycle: Incremental reprocessing

The optional top-level `previous_results` parameter lets you reuse results from a prior run to avoid reprocessing unchanged files so as to save time and compute costs.

```yaml
previous_results: examples/process/outputs/merged/merged_results.jsonl
```

Point it to a `merged_results.jsonl` produced by an earlier run. On the next run, each local input file is compared against that JSONL (meanwhile URL inputs are always reprocessed):

- Unchanged files: their previous samples are reused as-is.
- New or modified files: they are processed normally.
- Removed files: their samples are dropped from the output.

## :scroll: More information on what's under the hood

### :construction: Pipeline architecture

Our pipeline is a 3 steps process:
- **Crawling**: We first crawl over the file/folder to list all the files we need to process (by skipping those already processed).
- **Dispatching**: We then dispatch the files to the workers, using a dispatcher that will send the files to the workers in batches. This part is in charge of the load balancing between different nodes if the project is running in a distributed environment.
- **Processing**: The workers then process the files, using the appropriate tools for each file type. They extract the text, images, audio, and video frames, and send them to the next step. We defined for this a common data structure for saving document samples: [MultimodalSample](https://github.com/yueyili128-stack/polydoc/blob/master/src/polydoc/type.py#L38). Our goal is to provide an easy way to add new processors for new file types, or even other types of processing for existing file types.

## 🛠️ Used tools

We also use [Dask distributed](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/) to manage the distributed environment.

## :wrench: Customization
The system is designed to be extensible, allowing you to register custom processors for handling new file types or specialized processing. To implement a new processor you need to inherit the `Processor` class and implement only two methods:
- accepts: defines the file types your processor supports (e.g. docx)
- process: how to process a single file (input:file type, output: Multimodal sample, see other processors for reference)

See `TextProcessor` in `src/process/processors/text_processor.py` for a minimal example.

## :broom: Post-processing

Post-processing refines the extracted text data to improve quality for downstream tasks. The infrastructure is modular and extensible: polydoc natively supports the following post-processors: [**Chunker**](/src/polydoc/process/post_processor/chunker), [**Filter**](/src/polydoc/process/post_processor/filter), [**Named Entity Recognition**](/src/polydoc/process/post_processor/ner), and [**Tagger**](/src/polydoc/process/post_processor/tagger). Applying the **Chunker** is heavily recommended, as it cuts documents into reasonably sized chunks that are more specific to feed to an LLM.

The chunker supports a `table_handling` option to control how markdown tables are split:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `single_row` (default) | Each table row has its own chunk, with the header repeated for context |
| `multi_rows` | Rows are grouped to fill the chunk size, header repeated per chunk |
| `keep_whole` | Tables are never split and kept as one chunk regardless of size |
| `none` | No special table handling, tables are chunked like regular text |

You can configure parameters by providing a custom config file. You can find an example of a config file in the [examples folder](/examples/postprocessor/config.yaml).

Once ready, you can run the process using the following command:
```bash
python3 -m polydoc postprocess --config-file examples/postprocessor/config.yaml --input-data examples/process/outputs/merged/merged_results.jsonl
```

Specify with `--input-data` the path (absolute or relative to the root of the repository) to the JSONL recoding of the output of the initial processing phase.

### :recycle: Incremental post-processing

Like the processing pipeline, the post-processor accepts an optional `previous_results` parameter to reuse results from a prior post-processing run and skip unchanged documents.

```yaml
previous_results: examples/postprocessor/outputs/merged/results.jsonl
```

New post-processors can easily be implemented, and pipelines can be configured through lightweight YAML files. The post-processing stage produces a new JSONL file containing cleaned and optionally enhanced document samples.
